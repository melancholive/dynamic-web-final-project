# CONCEPT: 
RainbowRoad, a social media where  users post a seven image reel each a different color of the rainbow -- and since most images are not monochrome, it is up to the user's discretion which color an image portrays, providing some interesting gradiation throughout the feed. 

# Additional notes:
- Currently, users are able to submit six photos but are unable to change the order. In order for the photos to show up as intended, the files must be named in alphabetical order, starting from red.

# Possible Features:
- Themed Pages: art, photography, etc. (can be keywords collected through postContent)
- Color Spotlights: a page showing images of only one color
